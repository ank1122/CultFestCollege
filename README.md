A complete MERN stack website made for my college's annual cultural fest. Now since the fest is long over and the domain has also
been parked, this is now open source in order to expand it still further

# Technology Stack
1. React.Js
2. Node.Js (Express)
3. MongoDB

5. CSS (SCSS)

# Usage
Run ```npm update``` or anything equivalent to get it up and running with all the node.js dependencies neeeded to use this project.
